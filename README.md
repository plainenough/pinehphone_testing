# pinehphone_testing
If you are reading this you undoubtably will experience first hand my shitty code bases. No apologies. 

Seriously though, here are some tools that I am putting together for my testing efforts to validate some operating systems on the pinephone. Feel free to take, feel free to contribute, feel free to agree with the cruddiness of my code. 

# OSes being covered
* UBPorts
* Mobian

# OSes being onboarded next
* PostmarketOS
* Fedora
* PureOS

# OSes that will never recieve testing
* windows
